# 📘 Tailscale on Ubuntu: Installation, Configuration, and Usage Guide

## 📌 What is Tailscale?

Tailscale is a **VPN service** built on **WireGuard**. It creates a secure, encrypted mesh network between your devices — as if they were all on the same local network — using your identity provider (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.) for authentication.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

* An Ubuntu system (Desktop or Server)
* sudo privileges
* Internet connection
* A [Tailscale account](https://login.tailscale.com/)

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Install Tailscale

### 🔹 For Ubuntu 20.04 and newer:

1. **Update your packages**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Tailscale**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Start the Tailscale service**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start tailscaled 
   ```

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Authenticate Your Device

After running `sudo tailscale up`, you'll see a URL in the terminal like:

```
To authenticate, visit:
https://login.tailscale.com/a/abc123...
```

1. Copy the link and **open it in your browser**.
2. Log in with your preferred identity provider (Google, Microsoft, GitHub).
3. After successful login, your device is added to your Tailscale network.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Basic Configuration

### 🔹 Check Status

```bash
tailscale status
```

This will show connected devices and their IP addresses.

### 🔹 View Your Tailscale IP

```bash
tailscale ip
```

This shows the internal VPN IP (usually 100.x.x.x).

### 🔹 Ping Another Tailscale Device

```bash
ping <tailscale-ip-or-device-name>
```

---

## 🔒 Step 4: Allow Incoming Traffic (optional)

If you want this Ubuntu machine to be a server (e.g., for SSH, web server):

1. **Enable Tailscale subnet routing or expose a port:**

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # for SSH
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp   # for web server
   ```

2. (Optional) Share access to others in your Tailscale network using the **Tailscale admin panel**.

## 🛠 Step 5: Useful Tailscale Commands

| Command                 | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tailscale up`          | Starts and connects the VPN       |
| `tailscale down`        | Disconnects from Tailscale        |
| `tailscale status`      | View all connected devices        |
| `tailscale ip`          | Show your device's Tailscale IP   |
| `tailscale ping <host>` | Ping another Tailscale node       |
| `tailscale logout`      | Log out of your Tailscale account |

## 🌐 Accessing Services Securely

Suppose you have a web server running on port 8000. You can access it using:

```
http://<tailscale-ip>:8000
```

Or by hostname:

```
http://<device-name>.ts.net:8000
```

---

## 📌 Optional: Set as an Exit Node

To route *all* your traffic (like a VPN tunnel):

### On the server:

```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-exit-node
```

### On the client:

```bash
sudo tailscale up --exit-node=<device-name>
```

---

## 🧼 Uninstall Tailscale

If needed:

```bash
sudo apt remove tailscale
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/tailscale
```
