Certainly! Here's a **realistic scenario** where you're acting as a **System Administrator**, your co-workers are experiencing issues, and you need to **design and implement a system with a database** to solve the problem.

## ðŸ”§ Scenario: Employee Leave Management Problem

### ðŸ“Œ Background:

Your company currently manages employee leave requests via **email and spreadsheets**. This is causing:

* Lost or missed leave requests.
* No central record of leave balances.
* Delayed approvals from managers.
* Difficulty in calculating remaining annual leave.

As the **System Administrator**, you're tasked with designing and implementing a **centralized Employee Leave Management System** with a backend database.

---

## âœ… Objectives:

1. **Centralize** leave data in a database.
2. Provide an **interface for employees** to apply for leave.
3. Enable **managers** to approve/reject requests.
4. Track **leave balances** automatically.
5. Generate **reports** (monthly, yearly, by department, etc.)

---

## ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Solution Plan:

### **Step 1: Requirements Gathering**

* Meet with HR and department heads.
* Understand:

  * Types of leaves (annual, sick, unpaid, etc.).
  * Approval workflows.
  * Maximum leave limits per role.
  * Current pain points.

### **Step 2: System Design**

#### a. Database Design:

Design a relational database with tables like:

* `employees` (id, name, department, email, role)
* `leave_requests` (id, employee\_id, leave\_type, start\_date, end\_date, status, reason)
* `leave_balances` (employee\_id, leave\_type, total\_days, used\_days, remaining\_days)
* `users` (login credentials if authentication is needed)

#### b. System Architecture:

* Web-based application
* Stack: `React` (frontend) + `Node.js/Express` (backend) + `MySQL` (database)

#### c. Access Control:

* Employees: Request and view leave
* Managers: Approve/reject leaves
* HR/Admin: Configure leave policies, view reports

---

### **Step 3: Tool & Tech Setup**

* Set up a local development environment (Vite, Node.js, MySQL).
* Set up a development server (e.g., Ubuntu VM or Docker container).
* Configure version control (Git + GitHub or GitLab).
* Choose authentication method (JWT or OAuth if internal LDAP isn't available).

---

### **Step 4: Implementation**

#### a. Backend:

* Create RESTful APIs (e.g., `/leave/apply`, `/leave/status`, `/manager/approve`, `/reports`)
* Implement validation logic, leave balance updates
* Implement role-based access control

#### b. Frontend:

* Leave request form
* Leave approval dashboard
* Leave history view
* Report generation page

---

### **Step 5: Testing**

* Perform unit testing for backend logic
* Conduct user testing with a few employees and managers
* Fix bugs and gather feedback

---

### **Step 6: Deployment**

* Host the app on your internal server or use cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure)
* Secure it using HTTPS, firewalls, and proper permissions
* Set up database backups and monitoring tools

---

### **Step 7: Training & Documentation**

* Create a user guide and conduct training sessions.
* Document the system: architecture, database schema, API reference.

---

### **Step 8: Maintenance**

* Monitor performance and logs.
* Fix issues and roll out improvements based on feedback.

---

## ðŸ§© Result:

By designing and implementing this system:

* Employee leave tracking becomes automated and transparent.
* Managers are notified instantly for approvals.
* HR has accurate reports for payroll and compliance.
* Everyone saves time, and errors are reduced.
